\f0\fs24 \cf0 GUI is the graphical user interface that allows a person to interact with a screen and see what they are doing as they browse the internet or their computer. CLI is Command Line Interface which is when someone uses set commands to do what they are trying to do. To do this, you must memorize the commands, making it a lot harder and less useful than GUI, which is why GUI is seen everywhere.}
